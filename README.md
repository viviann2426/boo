# The Vast Trenches of my Brain
Welcome to the site I will be using to dump all of my intrusive thoughts into, aside from the ideas that would get me clocked by school admin. I have a great number of 9 things that bring me joy in life, so I will be ranting about a small assortment of them.

## Webtoons, Manga, and Fanfiction
Daily passes and spending coins hurts me. I'm fairly certain that in ten years' time, I will be living in a cheap, run-down apartment with a low-paying job, and spending every penny I have on buying more coins. If I become successful, it will be purely for the purpose of buying coins or supporting the author's patreon.
After much consideration, I think the last topic is taboo, and will not be elaborating further.

Regarding their other menu selections, whether they taste better or worse is entirely dependent on the state of your mental health.

## Pokémon
Mr. Mime is majestic. Mr. Mime is striking. Mr. Mime is a projection of me in my entirety. Change my mind.
Also in my genius opinion, there should exist another final evolution of Mr. Mime called "Megamime" with the largest eighthead in the Pokémon universe.

## My failed fanfiction
I remember my first attempt at unobligatory, fictional writing. It was god-awful and if I ever find the notebook I used to brainstorm all my ideas, I'm going to burn it.

It gave me bad ideas, my creation the case in point.
